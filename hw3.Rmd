summary(plm(spi_mean ~ lag+lag_neighbor+num_years, q1_b_lag, effect = "twoways", model = "within", index = "district"))
```

From the result shown above, we can see that the SPI is not independent from one election period to the next within a district. They have a positive coefficient around 1, and the p value is less than 0.05, indicating that is statistically significant.

summary(pglm(extreme_count ~ lag_extreme + lag_extreme_neighbor + num_years, q1_c_lag, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Comparing the result in part c to part b, the coefficient is close to 0, so we can conclude that the number of moderate droughts or floods is independent from one election period to the next within a district, as well as from neighboring districts from one election period to the next.


## Question 2
### A)
```{r}
q2_a = q1_c_count

```

```{r}
q2_b_issue = unique(election_results[,c(7,8)])
q2_b = unique(q1_c_neighbor_mean2)
q2_b = merge(q2_b_issue,q2_b)

#check all the types of party issue
unique(q2_b$party_issue)
#"liberal", "religious","economic_farming","far left","economic_nonfarming","far right","ethnic regional"
```

Liberal
```{r}
q2_b_libiral <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "liberal"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_libiral, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Economic Farming
```{r}
q2_b_economic_farming <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "economic_farming"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_economic_farming, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Far Left
```{r}
q2_b_far_left <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "far left"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_far_left, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Economic Nonfarming
```{r}
q2_b_economic_nonfarming <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "economic_nonfarming"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_economic_nonfarming, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Far Right
```{r}
q2_b_far_right <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "far right"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_far_right, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Ethnic Regional
```{r}
q2_b_ethnic_regional <- unique(q2_b[(q2_b$party_issue == "ethnic regional"),c(3:8)])
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + num_years, q2_b_ethnic_regional, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

Based on the seven regressions above, we can see that extreme weather has different effects on each political parties. By looking at the coefficients and p-value, Liberal and Far Left political parties are more likely to be formed when a district experiences extreme weather. Ethnic Regional political parties are also slightly more likely to be formed when a district experiences extreme weather. The rest of the kinds of political parties are independent from the extreme weather.

### B)
```{r}
q2_b_b <- unique(q1_c_neighbor_mean3)

#delete NA values rows
q2_b_b <- q2_b_b[is.na(q2_b_b$extreme_count) == FALSE,]

summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + neighbor_extreme_mean + num_years, q2_b_b, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))
```

From the result shown above, we can see that the numbers of parties founded is independent from the number of years its neighboring districts experience years of droughts or flooding from  one election period to the next within a district. the coefficient is close to 0, and the p value is larger than 0.05, indicating that is not statistically significant.

```{r}
summary(pglm(n ~ extreme_count + neighbor_extreme_mean + num_years, q2_b_b, effect = "twoways", model = "within",  index = "district", family = "poisson"))

From the result shown above, we can see that the the HHIâ€™s concentration (fragmentation of
political power) is independent from the extreme weather counts from one election period to the next within a district. The coefficient is close to 0, and the p value is larger than 0.05, indicating that is not statistically significant.

Based on the two regressions above, we can see that whether the new parties that appear in a district
are the same parties that have appeared in neighboring districts in the past has different effects on number of parties founded. By looking at the coefficients and p-value, new political parties being founded in a district that have not contested an election in a neighboring district in any previous election period are more dependent to the extreme weather counts and lagged neighbor extreme weather counts. On the contrast, new political parties being founded in a district, that have contested an election in a neighboring district in any previous election period are independent to the extreme weather.
